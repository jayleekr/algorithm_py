# Integers in Python can be as big as the bytes in your machine's memory. There is no limit in size as there is:  (c++ int) or  (C++ long long int).

# As we know, the result of  grows really fast with increasing .

# Let's do some calculations on very large integers.

# Task
# Read four numbers, , , , and , and print the result of .

# Input Format
# Integers , , , and  are given on four separate lines, respectively.
